# ETF-Analyzer

## Summary 
This program analyzes the performance of an ETF (exchange-traded fund). The application runs through four different stocks:  
  - Green Dot Coportation (GDOT)
  - Goldman Sachs Group (GS)
  - Paypal Holdings (PYPL)
  - Block Inc (SQ)  
Then the program deploys the visualizations to a web application by using the Voila library.
